Destroy human benchmark games with this script. That's it.

## Performance
On a ***75 Hz*** refresh rate monitor:

## Usage

You can download the Windows executable from the [releases](https://github.com/codynhanpham/human-benchmark/releases) page.

Also, download the English trained data [eng.traineddata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/blob/main/eng.traineddata) file and place it in the same directory as the executable. This is required for optical character recognition (OCR) tasks.

Since OCR is not perfect, tests requiring OCR may requires a few tries to get a good result.

Launch the executable and follow the instructions.
